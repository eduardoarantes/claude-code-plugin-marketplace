# Claude Code Plugin Marketplace

A marketplace for Claude Code plugins focused on production-ready Python development.

## Installation

### Adding the Marketplace

To add this marketplace to your Claude Code installation, use one of the following methods:

**Option 1: From a local directory**

If you've cloned this repository locally:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-code-plugin-marketplace
```

Replace `/path/to/claude-code-plugin-marketplace` with the absolute path to the directory where you cloned this repository.

**Option 2: From GitHub (when published)**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add owner/repo
```

Replace `owner/repo` with the GitHub repository path.

### Important Notes

- Point to the **directory** (not the marketplace.json file directly)
- Claude Code will automatically look for `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in that directory
- Plugin source paths in the marketplace are resolved relative to the marketplace directory root

## Available Plugins

## Troubleshooting

### Marketplace installs but plugins not found

Make sure you're pointing to the marketplace **directory**, not the marketplace.json file:

❌ Wrong: `/plugin marketplace add ./.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
✅ Correct: `/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/marketplace`

### Plugin directory not found error

Verify that:
1. The plugin directory exists at the root level (e.g., `./python-coding-agents`)
2. The source path in marketplace.json starts with `./`
3. The plugin has a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` file

## Contributing

To add new plugins to this marketplace:

1. Create your plugin directory at the root level
2. Add a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` file with required metadata
3. Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to include your plugin:

```json
{
  "name": "your-plugin-name",
  "source": "./your-plugin-directory",
  "description": "Brief description of your plugin"
}
```
