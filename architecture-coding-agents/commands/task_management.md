# General Task Creation Definition

- Tasks should be created using the linear tooling

## Working on tasks

**INPROGRESSLABEL**

- is it mandatory everytime BEFORE YOU ARE GOING to start working on a task to move it to "in progress"
- only one issue/task can be IN PROGRESS at a time so first check if there is any other issue/task with this label and confirm with the user if he want to start working on the task/issue or continue working on the marked one, move the other tasks to TO DO.

## Task Status Management

- IMPORTANT: Tasks can only be moved to the next step if the code is compiling and tests are passing

## Managing Task Dependencies

- Add a dependency by adding the task/issue number to the "dependencies" array in the task body
- Add a dependency by removing the task/issue number from the "dependencies" array in the task body
- Check and avoid circular dependencies
- Dependencies need to be checked for existence before being added or removed

# Task Creation Guidelines:

- You are an AI assistant helping to pick a goal/milestone and break down from the milestone specif file at the @milestones folder and also use for reference on Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the memory bank into a set of sequential development tasks.
- Make sure to clarify which goal are you going to break down in tasks
- Create a milestone for this goal
- Make sure to call add-sub-issue tool to the link the sub-task to the task
- Your goal is to create 10 well-structured, actionable development tasks based on the PRD provided and the memory bank and the request itself
- Each task should be atomic and focused on a single responsibility
- Order tasks logically - consider dependencies and implementation sequence
- Early tasks should focus on setup, core functionality first, then advanced features
- Include clear validation/testing approach for each task
- Set appropriate dependency IDs
- Assign priority (high/medium/low) based on criticality and dependency order
- If the PRD contains specific requirements for libraries, database schemas, frameworks, tech stacks, or any other implementation details, STRICTLY ADHERE to these requirements in your task breakdown and do not discard them under any circumstance
- Focus on filling in any gaps left by the PRD or areas that aren't fully specified, while preserving all explicit requirements
- Always aim to provide the most direct path to implementation, avoiding over-engineering or roundabout approaches
- Include detailed implementation guidance in the "details" field
- Each task should follow this structure (should be created using the linear tooling, please create the labels if needed):
  - id: it will be provided by the tool when created
  - number: also provided by the tool when created
  - title: Short and concise task summary
  - body:
    - description: string - detailed task description
    - dependencies: number [] (numbers of the tasks this depends on)
    - details: string (implementation details)
    - testStrategy: string (validation approach)
  - status: open
  - milestone: the milestone created for the goal this task belongs to
  - labels: "status/pending" or "status/blocked" and "priority/high or priority/medium or priority/low"

# Task BreakDown (Subtasks) Guidelines:

- You are an AI assistant helping to break down a given open task into a set of sequential development tasks.
- Your goal is to create 3 well-structured, actionable development tasks based on the PRD provided.
- Make sure to clarify which task are you going to break down in sub- tasks
- Each task should be atomic and focused on a single responsibility
- Order tasks logically - consider dependencies and implementation sequence
- Early tasks should focus on setup, core functionality first, then advanced features
- Include clear validation/testing approach for each task
- Set appropriate dependency IDs
- Assign priority (high/medium/low) based on criticality and dependency order
- If the PRD contains specific requirements for libraries, database schemas, frameworks, tech stacks, or any other implementation details, STRICTLY ADHERE to these requirements in your task breakdown and do not discard them under any circumstance
- Focus on filling in any gaps left by the PRD or areas that aren't fully specified, while preserving all explicit requirements
- Always aim to provide the most direct path to implementation, avoiding over-engineering or roundabout approaches
- Include detailed implementation guidance in the "details" field
- Each task should follow this structure (should be created using the github tooling, please create the labels if needed):
  - id: it will be provided by the tool when created
  - number: also provided by the tool when created
  - title: Short and concise task summary
  - body:
    - description: string - detailed task description
    - dependencies: number [] (numbers of the tasks this depends on)
    - details: string (implementation details)
    - testStrategy: string (validation approach)
  - status: open
  - milestone: the milestone created for the goal this task belongs to
  - labels: "status/pending" or "status/blocked" and "priority/high or priority/medium or priority/low" and "SUB-TASK"

## Task Complexity Analysis

- Analise the current goal tasks and also rank them between 1-10 complexity
- Create a complexity report in the memory-bank folder
- Focus on tasks with highest complexity scores (8-10) for detailed breakdown
- Use analysis results to determine appropriate subtask allocation
